This is the README for the imperial RPG and roleplaying bot. It is a combination of many  `github repositories`
, this is what will soon be displayed on [Autocode Apps](/app).
**Anybody is free to use the code** as it wouldnt be fair to me to use somebody else's code and not allow anybody to use mine.


## Token file
You will not see any token file because it is already linked through Autocode.

## GitHub
If you decide to fork this project, you can press the **Open in Autocode** button as displayed above.
This will enable anybody to fork the project in Autocode directly. The bot will also be hosted through Autocode

## Note
The project is still ongoing and being worked on so if something doesn't make sense, that's why.
